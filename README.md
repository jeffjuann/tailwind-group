## Installation
### Install Package

import { twExtractor } from "tailwind-group";

const config = {
  ...
  content: {
    files: [
      './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
      './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
      './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
      './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    ],
    extract: twExtractor(["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx"]),
  },
  ...
} satisfies Config

export default config
```

### Usage
```ts
 twOn("hover", "bg-blue-500") 
 // or
 twOnHover("bg-blue-500")
```

```ts
import { twOnHover as onHover } from 'tailwind-group'
```
This package operates by customizing the Tailwind classes detection in your codebase. It detects particular patterns such as `twOn`, `twOnHover`, and other patterns within your code.
```ts
  twOn('hover', 'bg-sky-500', twOn('dark', 'bg-sky-700'))  
```
